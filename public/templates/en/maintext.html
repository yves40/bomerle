  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>
     Beaumerle is a company that manufactures art knives.
     Each model is original because I don't like making series.
     My knives, mostly folding, use all types of materials.
     Both for handles, bolsters and blades.
  </p>
  <p>
     I create them entirely, over the course of my inspiration and...
     requests from my clients.
     Sales are made at trade fairs or through contacts on the internet
     who appreciate my creations.
